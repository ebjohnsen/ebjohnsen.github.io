Digital twins are emerging as an engineering paradigm to build software centred around models of physical objects or processes, with very diverse application domains. The purpose of a digital twin is to understand, predict and act on the behaviour of these physical systems. In engineering, the use of digital twins profoundly changes the management of the entire product lifecycle, from design to manufacturing and operations, because the digital twins adapt in response to the evolution of their physical counterpart. In this talk, we discuss digital twins from the perspective of behavioural models. We share some ideas about model evolution in digital twins from this perspective, tell you about our current research activities on digital twins at the University of Oslo, and discuss some ensuing research challenges at the intersection of formal methods and software engineering.\nBio.

Although digital services are supposed to simplify our lives and increase our efficiency, they often frustrate and burden customers, users, and employees.\nThe overall goal is to increase the quality of services and support the successful digitalisation of services by uniting research on process mining and customer journeys using new developments in logic-based analysis and artificial intelligence.\nBased on user journeys we will analyse, model, and observe how humans experience digital services, rather than taking the perspective of service providers and service systems.\nThe main source of data comes from two complementary service providers: GrepS, a start-up company offering software services for analysing programming skills, and Telenor, a telecom company offering a wide range of mobile-, broadband- and TV services in the Nordics and in Asia.\nWe will trace data left from users in various systems during repeated interactions with a service over time, on the level of individuals. In the first phase of the project, we will build tools for automated capture of repeated user interactions in digital channels. Based on the resulting database of user journeys and user models, we will use logic-based techniques and machine learning to expose deviations and predict possible behaviours. The accumulation of user journeys will also enable identification of patterns that optimize the user experience and service quality.\nWe will extend and use executable modelling languages and their associated analysis tools to describe, predict, and prescribe user journeys as concurrent processes.

I was the project leader of CUMULUS.\nThe main goal of Cumulus is to develop a semantic foundation for static analysis techniques for cloud-aware applications. Cloud-awareness enables the software to negotiate its own quality of service and opens for dynamic and fine-grained resource management. This introduces an element of reflection which goes beyond the state of the art in both formal semantics and static analysis. The project will develop a formal foundation for cloud-aware computing and use this foundation to enable the verification of quantitative assertions about the high-level quality of service and low-level resource requirements of cloud-aware applications. The project will develop demonstrators for the approach in terms of semantics-based tools to analyze quantitative assertions for quality of service during the design of such applications. Cumulus will enable a shift in the design of virtualized software from model simulation and monitoring deployed systems to advanced static analyses of worst-case resource requirements early in the software design\n","date":1486070252,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1486070252,"objectID":"dd9842430bba8215f60eec95321c9079","permalink":"https://ebjohnsen.org/project/cumulus/","publishdate":"2017-02-02T22:17:32+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/cumulus/","section":"project","summary":"An RCN FRINATEK research project 2015-2019.

CORDIS website here.\nIn open distributed systems, the availability and requirements of components providing services vary over time. The networks need to dynamically reconfigure communication links between components at run-time in a context-aware manner. This reconfiguration includes the (dis)connection of components, but also the adaptation and updating of both components and the network. Updates may change the computation abilities of components and the coordination abilities of the network. For safety-critical systems, update should not compromise the reliability of services. Updates should be initiated and effectuated in a decentralized manner. No formal model of computation and communication exists today in which end-to-end system evolution can be expressed and validated. The use of formal models and validation techniques will significantly improve the confidence in dynamically reconfigurable systems, which are otherwise error-prone.\nThis project aims at a compositional modelling and validation framework for dynamically evolving software systems, separating computation, coordination, and scheduling. Exploiting this separation of concerns, we develop a uniform modelling language in which object-oriented components are combined with flexible communication and timing models. A new notion of service interface is essential, allowing separate design and validation of different components and of the network. Interface composition enables end-to-end reasoning about evolving systems. These interfaces specify services and formalize the context awareness needed for run-time coordination and reconfiguration. The framework will help developers design and maintain systems by validating reconfigurations. We focus on automatable and compositional validation techniques, including abstract simulation, synthesis, model-checking, test-generation, and verification of interface compatibility. The usefulness of the framework is assessed through case studies, and by developing an integrated tool.\n","date":1437508511,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1437508511,"objectID":"f3b75c1d65cf46b284e1ba7862458c82","permalink":"https://ebjohnsen.org/project/credo/","publishdate":"2015-07-21T21:55:11+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/credo/","section":"project","summary":"A

The introduction of such partial specifications requires extra care when reasoning about systems as several specifications of an object may coexist and lead to overlapping information. In this paper, we consider a compositional approach to system  development by  means  of  partial  specifications of objects. The approach supports stepwise refinement, which enables  global  reasoning  by  local  refinement  steps  in  an aspect-oriented specification style.  For this purpose, a refinement relation is proposed which is suitable for multiple inheritance of behavior and component upgrade.","tags":[],"title":"Composition and Refinement for Partial Object Specifications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Einar Broch Johnsen","Olaf Owe"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1016743605,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1016743605,"objectID":"c5e005719c959f44c6a11d51e5b10e78","permalink":"https://ebjohnsen.org/publication/02-fmoods/","publishdate":"2020-07-21T23:25:40+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/02-fmoods/","section":"publication","summary":"Proc.

In this paper we propose an incremental treatment of faults as  a  refinement  process  on  object-oriented  system  specifications.   An  intolerant  system  specification is  a  natural abstraction from which a fault-tolerant system can evolve. With each refinement step a fault and its treatment are introduced, so the fault-tolerance of the system increases during the design process. Different kinds of faults are identified and captured by separate refinement relations according to how the tolerant system relates to abstract properties of the intolerant one in terms of safety and liveness.  The specification language utilized is object-oriented and based upon first-order predicates on communication traces. Fault-tolerance refinement relations are formalized within this framework","tags":[],"title":"Incremental Fault-Tolerant Design in an Object-Oriented Setting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Einar Broch Johnsen","Wenhui Zhang","Olaf Owe","Demissie B.

This paper describes an approach that emphasizes both aspects, by combining UML with a language for observable behavior of interfaces, OUN. These are complementary in the sense that one is graphical and semi-formal while the other is textual and formal. The approach is demonstrated by a case study.","tags":[],"title":"Specification of Distributed Systems with a Combination of Graphical and Formal Languages","type":"publication"}]
