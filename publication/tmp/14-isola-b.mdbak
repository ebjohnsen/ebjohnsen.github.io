abstract = "This paper critically discusses the different choices that have to be made when defining a fault model for an object-oriented programming language. We consider in particular the ABS language, and analyze the interplay between the fault model and the main features of ABS, namely the cooperative concurrency model, based on asynchronous method invocations whose return results via futures, and its emphasis on static analysis based on invariants."
