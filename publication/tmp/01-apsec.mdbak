abstract = "Convenience in specification and possibility for formal analysis are, to some extent, exclusive aspects of system specification. This paper describes an approach that emphasizes both aspects, by combining UML with a language for observable behavior of interfaces, OUN. These are complementary in the sense that one is graphical and semi-formal while the other is textual and formal. The approach is demonstrated by a case study."
