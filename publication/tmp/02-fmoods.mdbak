abstract = "Aspect-oriented approaches have recently been proposed to address the problem of specifying dynamic object-based systems, by depicting the various roles of the  objects  separately.   In  this  paper,  we  consider  an  approach based on the observable behavior of objects and propose a specification formalism for reusable object interfaces with input/output-driven assumption-guarantee predicates. The formalism supports compositional reasoning and exchange of object identities between objects in an environment where the number of objects is unbounded."
