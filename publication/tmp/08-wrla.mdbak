abstract = "This paper develops a rewriting logic specification of the connection method for first-order logic, implemented in Maude. The connection method is a goal-directed proof procedure that requires a careful control over clause copies. The specification separates the inference rule layer from the rule application layer, and implements the latter at Maude's meta-level. This allows us to develop and compare different strategies for proof search."
